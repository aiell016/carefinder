                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mission Got Your Six project is a website project for a local, non-profit, veteran's organization.
                Their slogan is "Never Alone,  22", is one that they hope will raise awareness of the fact that 22 veterans commit suicide each year, and this
                mission's goal is to provide medical and other services free of charge to first responders and Unites States Veterans.
                The organization offers networking opportunities by hosting activites, softball games, and social events. Fundraising and donations are important components, and are 
                greatly appreciated and needed in order to offer this support for our Heroes.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conference website design and build was assigned to me during the early spring of 2018 by one of our
                Computer Science professors, Dr. Zaid Altahat.  I've continued the project for 2 years and designed the current 2019 conference. 
                This 2019 website covers one of several of these conferences that occur frequently in various regions of the United States.
                The conference offers workshops, classes, discussions, panels, and other activities.  The website offers guides, registration,
                maps, and information about the conference. This conference also gives scholars a chance for submitting a paper for conference publication in IEEE,
                The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, (sometimes just called I-Triple-E).

        <div>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On The Radar is an academic planning application that helps students. 
                It  is a web-based application using  a MEVN stack (MongoDB Express.js VueJS Node.js.)  
                The app is being developed to be used by students, advisors, and department administrators.  
                Students must meet certain requirements within their general education courses in order to 
                complete their general education requirements for their major or program. The app will help 
                guide which course combinations meet those requirements by using an interactive radar graph.  
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next team to take over this project rewrote the app using Angular.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Volga was the first site I designed after Computer Science 1. 
                This project came from Web Concepts I and II.  Volga is a river, like the Nile River, or the Amazon River.
                Well, this is project Volga, and it functions like the other e-commerce rivers, kind of.  This site focused
                on the front end for the first semester, and the back end for the second semester.  Project Volga was one
                of the most fun and challenging projects to complete. This is before I’ve had design classes.
                I’m just saying. Click on the screen shots to go into that website.

                 Software Engineering 1 and 2 project. The website is built using WordPress on an
                 AWS LAMP stack in an EC2 instance. In other words, this site is hosted on
                 Amazon Web Services (AWS) and is built using WordPress. The site features screenshots
                 of some of the apps built by student intern programmers and designers in the App Factory, 
                 an on-campus business that develops applications for regional businesses and organizations.
