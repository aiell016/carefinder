                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mission Got Your Six project is a website project for a local, non-profit, veteran's organization.
                Their slogan is "Never Alone,  22", is one that they hope will raise awareness of the fact that 22 veterans commit suicide each year, and this
                mission's goal is to provide medical and other services free of charge to first responders and Unites States Veterans.
                The organization offers networking opportunities by hosting activites, softball games, and social events. Fundraising and donations are important components, and are 
                greatly appreciated and needed in order to offer this support for our Heroes.

                This 2019 website covers one of several of these conferences that occur frequently in various regions of the United States.
                The conference offers workshops, classes, discussions, panels, and other activities.  The website offers guides, registration,
                maps, and information about the conference. This conference also gives scholars a chance for submitting a paper for conference publication in IEEE,
                The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, (sometimes just called I-Triple-E).

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On The Radar is an academic planning application that helps students. 
                It  is a web-based application using  a MEVN stack (MongoDB Express.js VueJS Node.js.)  
                The app is being developed to be used by students, advisors, and department administrators.  
                Students must meet certain requirements within their general education courses in order to 
                complete their general education requirements for their major or program. The app will help 
                guide which course combinations meet those requirements by using an interactive radar graph.

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next team to take over this project rewrote the app using Angular.

                Well, this is project Volga, and it functions like the other e-commerce rivers, kind of.  This site focused
                on the front end for the first semester, and the back end for the second semester.  Project Volga was one
                of the most fun and challenging projects to complete. This is before I’ve had design classes.

                The Save The Tigers website is a conservation website that began as a research assignment for  Art 377
                Web Design class.  We were to research an endangered species and build a basic 4 or 5-page website
                that raises awareness for the cause. The website design had to be within specifications and we had to
                make all of the design elements with the Adobe Suite, which includes Illustrator and PhotoShop. 
                All of the code such as HTML and CSS are all written from scratch--it's not a prebuilt content 
                management system.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This website project was originally designed in our Art 377 Web Design class at the university.
                We had to select an individual restaurant, not a chain, and create an updated look and design, using our digital design skillset.
                I chose a friend's restaurant, Barnacle Buds located in Bay View, just minutes south of downtown Milwaukee off of South KK Avenue.
                All of the code such as HTML and CSS are all written from scratch--it's not a prebuilt content management system. All artwork
                and icons have been done by hand.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This website project is made using Weebly.com for a local entrepreneur.  This project
                was a group project for our Management Information Systems MIS 220 class.  Our specifications were to build an
                E-commerce website that fits all of her products.  This is one of our first website projects for a client, and our
                first website team project from my time as an undergraduate.
